LunchMoney aims to bring the gig economy to restaurants through defi.

LunchMoney is a web3 platform that incentivizes real feedback from restaurant customers worldwide with instant payments in LMY.
LunchMoney users must connect their Metamask or Walletlink to use LunchMoney.
Once connected, LMY can be purchased through Indacoin or Uniswap, since LMY is needed to interact with the platform.
Users can earn LMY simply by completing surveys for select restaurant chains and inputting the validation codes on the LunchMoney Rewards page.
Using the LunchMoney Leaderboard, a percentage of LMY can be earned, based on the balance of LMY held in connected wallets. 
The more LMY you hold, the more LMY you can earn.
